##  Problem Statement

Traveling alone at night often feels unsafe due to dark zones, past crime history, or low crowd density. No real-time system ensures both route safety and situational awareness.

##  Solution Overview

LumosPath aims to provide a structured approach using:

- Intuitive user interface  
- Clean navigation and user flow  
- Simple and scalable solution architecture  
- Clear demonstration of the core idea using a frontend prototype and backend API

It is a real-time intelligent safety navigation app that not only shows the fastest route but also the safest, by analyzing:
- Dynamic lighting levels (via IoT streetlight sensors + user camera inputs)
- Live crowd density and movement patterns (via CCTV, public APIs)
- Historical crime & accident data (geo-tagged)
- Sentiment from social media (e.g., tweets/posts about unsafe spots)
- Emergency proximity (police stations, hospitals, safe houses)
